This is a sample app showcasing a browser-based editor
([Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)) syncing its content with
the file system. It is using the
[File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API),
in conjunction with the [Yjs](https://yjs.dev/) CRDT implementation.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.
